    - The best way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours. These are posted (and updated) below under my [office hours section]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours). This is the BEST way to work with me. Just come by during one of those posted times.
    - If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email me. (I will check my email at least once per day)
