# Homework

The following code produces a bouncing ball that stays within the canvas window. Also notice, that when you click in the canvas, the angle of the ball's path changes.

<div id="jotted-demo-1" class="jotted-theme-stacked"></div>

<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-1"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            hide: false,
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/master/hwExamples/HW-7/sketch.js"
        },
        {
            type: "html",
            hide: true,
            url:"../../../p5_resources/index.html"
        }
    ],
    showBlank: false,
    showResult: true,
    plugins: [
        { name: 'ace', options: { "maxLines": 50 } },
        // { name: 'console', options: { autoClear: true } },
    ]
});
</script>

For your homework this week, you are to download the above code package from the following link.

- [**Code Download**](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/raw/master/hwExamples/HW-7/HW-7.zip)

#### Part 1

In the `readme.md` file, you should then;

- Describe, in detail, what the original code is doing. Make sure to address;
    1. Why is it working the way it is?
    2. What does each line do?
    3. How can you make the ball change direction?

#### Part 2

Alter the code and make it more "interesting". Make changes to the Bouncing Ball sketch that make it more interesting to you. Please must some of the additional techniques presented this week.
