# Weekly Conclusions

We covered a lot of ground the last two weeks, introducing a brand new language, looking at how to make static figures, and turning your GitHub repo into a live webpage.

- Chapter 1
- Chapter 3


## Next Week

Next week, we start to animate with p5! So, make sure you are all caught up and ready to get going on that Thursday!
