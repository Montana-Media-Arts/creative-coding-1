This week you will make your first creative work with p5! Specifically, I am asking you to make a "self-portrait" or a "monster" drawing, using only p5 functions and procedures. We will cover a number of additional functions and topics this week to help you with this task.

This week will focus almost entirely on programming in p5. There will be no new material or review for Git, GitHub, syncing local and remote repositories, markdown, Atom, or your weekly readme. We have covered those topics in the past few weeks. However, you hopefully recognize that these topics will be critical to your ability to complete, upload, and submit this weeks homework. So, if you are still having problems with these areas, please get help from;

- The Media Arts Lab (McGill, rm 127).
- The GitHub issue's board.
- The previous week's content and videos.
- Your classmates (and that study group you should work to setup).
- My office hours.


<br />

OK, on to this weeks content!
