# Homework<br>Drawing Portraits

For this weeks homework, I want you to draw a portrait in p5, using the 2D Primitive Shape functions, color functions, positions functions, and order of operation techniques.

More specifically, I want you to either draw a self-portrait (i.e. of yourself) or a portrait of a monster (imaginary or based from someone else's).
