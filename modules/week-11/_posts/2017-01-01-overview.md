OK, so, you have just started to get the hang of coding, p5, and JavaScript! Congratulations, you are at a great point in the semester.

However, this week we are going to explore another exciting and potentially confusing subject. Sorry,... _not sorry_. This week explores _Object Oriented Programming_ (_OOP_).

This new (to you) programming paradigm is a shift in how we think about code. We will move away from a procedural approach, in which we thought about every instruction, as a set list of orders, that must be followed one after the other. Instead, we will start to consider what the world would be like if we thought more abstractly about programming, and treated development as a set of _things_ or _objects_? The goal this week is to consider how we can "zoom out" a bit, if you will, and start to think about code as objects interacting with other objects.

The goal of this work is not to make your life more difficult, although I am sure in the short term it will. Instead, the goal of this work is to make your coding skills more flexible and capable of dealing with large problems.
