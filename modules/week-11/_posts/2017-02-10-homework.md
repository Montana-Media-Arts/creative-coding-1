# HW 11 | Objects

For your homework this week you are to create a sketch and simple class that can create 10-40 objects that _do something_ on the canvas.

## Specification

The class you create should allow each object to have its own unique behavior. Additionally this class should have;

- a `constructor` method that sets up all properties for _new_ objects.
- at least two other methods that cause these objects to _do something_ on the screen.

In your `setup()` function, you should create the objects and add them to an array.

In your `draw()` function, you should call the appropriate methods on each object so they _do something_, whatever that thing is that they do.

As always, you should comment your code, write a readme, and provide links on the forum to both your git repo, and live sketch.




## Examples

As examples, you can look at either of the code examples on the [Array of Objects Page]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-11/objects-arrays/#altogether)
