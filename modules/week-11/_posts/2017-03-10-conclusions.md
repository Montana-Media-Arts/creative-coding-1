# Weekly Conclusions

This is another important week, with a topic that you **will use** throughout your coding life. Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that has become pervasive within computer science and software design.

We will continue to discuss the application of OOP throughout the rest of the semester.



## Next Week

Next week, I will introduce your final project parameters. We will also continue exploring OOP techniques, as well as how to start using media within your sketches.
