# Strings

Another data type that we should be aware of are _strings_. A string is any collection of characters, surrounded by a matching set of either double or single quotations.

The following are all examples of string;

```js
"This is a string"
'this is a string too'
"four - one = three"
'5'
'!*/%^'
```

Remember from the discussion on ["Exposing Data"]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-6/console-log/), that the text function (`text()`), takes as its first input any parameter that can be converted to a string, including a string. So, we could pass any of the above strings to that function, to display it on the canvas.

```js
var text2Print = "This is some text in a string!!!";
textSize( 34 );
text( text2Print, 10, height/2 );
```

<div class="displayed_jotted_example">
    <div id="jotted-demo-1" class=""></div>
</div>
<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-1"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/master/lecture_code/06/10_strings_01/sketch.js"
        },
        {
            type: "html",
            url:"../../../p5_resources/index.html"
    }],
    // plugins: [ "codemirror", "console" ]
    plugins: [ "codemirror" ]
});
</script>

Notice, that the quotation marks are not printed, only the text inside the quotation marks. If you want to use quotation marks inside a string, you have two options.

The first, is to use the _other_ quotation marks to encapsulate the string. Notice that in the following example, double quotation marks are used to wrap a string containing a single quotation mark or apostrophe. Then single quotation marks are used to encapsulate a a string, with a quote in it. Notice, in the last example, the color coding breaks, because we try to use a single quote, inside a string encapsulated in single quotes.


{% highlight js %}
var one = "This Mark's first exam.";
var two = 'Today Mark mentioned he "really prefers dogs".';
var three = 'This breaks Mark's code';
{% endhighlight %}

The other way to use the same type of quotation marks in a string is to _"escape"_ them. This is done with the backslash (the key above return). An _escaped_ character tells the computer to treat the proceeding character as part of the string, and _not_ a command for it.

```js
var string1 = "This is an example of \"escaped\" quotation marks."
text( string1, 10, height/2 );
```

## The Difference Between Strings and Numbers

Strings are not Numbers. However;

- A string may contain a Number/s.
- Numbers can be converted to strings.
- Strings with _only_ number characters, can be converted to Numbers.

String and Number data types are stored differently inside of the computers memory. They are also treated differently by the computer compiler.

#### Converting Numbers to Strings

To convert a Number to a String, the string function (`String()`) can be invoked, passing the Number as a parameter to the function.

```js
String(x)         // returns a string from a number variable x
String(123)       // returns a string from a number literal 123
String(100 + 23)  // returns a string from a number from an expression
```

#### Converting Strings to Numbers

To convert a string, containing only numbers characters to Number data type, use the "positive unary operator" (`+`), prepended in-front of the string, or variable holding the string. The positive unary operator, is related to the "negative unary operator", that can be used to _switch_ the sign of a Number. **NOTE:** The positive unary operator needs to _directly_ proceed the string. (i.e. no spaces)

```js
"44" // ← returns the string "44"
+"44" // ← returns the Number 44

var der = "44";
der // ← returns the string "44"
+der // ← returns the Number 44
```
The `Number()` function can also be used to turn valid strings to Numbers.

```js
Number("44")      // returns 44
Number("3.14")    // returns 3.14
Number(" ")       // returns 0
Number("")        // returns 0
Number("99 88")   // returns NaN, since there is a space
Number("forty")   // returns NaN, since the string includes non-number characters
```

## String Addition

There are not many operators that we can apply directly to Strings. However, one that will be used often is _string addition_. As with _arithmetic addition_, string addition uses the _addition operator_ (`+`). String addition, as you might suspect, adds to strings together, making them one string.

In the following example, the strings `st1` and `st2` are added together. At first, since no space is included, the words run together. The second example, shows the use of string addition to add a string with a space (`" "`) in between.

```js
var st1 = "Hi";
var st2 = "I'm Michael";
var st3 = st1 + st2;

// st3 = "HiI'm Michael";

st3 = st1 + " " + st2;
// st3 = "Hi I'm Michael";
```

String addition can also be used to add Numbers to Strings. This is how I have been printing out variables with the `text()` function.

In the following example, from the math operator page, the variables are displayed in the string. But they are _added_ to strings, thereby converting them to strings.

```js
text( "width: " + width, 20, 40 );
text( "pos_x: " + pos_x, 20, 80 );
```


<div class="displayed_jotted_example">
    <div id="jotted-demo-2" class="" height="150px;"></div>
</div>
<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-2"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/master/lecture_code/06/02_modulo_03/sketch.js"
        },
        {
            type: "html",
            url:"../../../p5_resources/index.html"
    }],
    // plugins: [ "codemirror", "console" ]
    plugins: [ "codemirror" ]
});
</script>
