# Weekly Conclusions

This week was intense with respect to math, mapping, variables, and data types. Which are, all math-y type topics. If you are not a math person, I understand if you are not excited about this weeks content. However, as mentioned earlier, you will find that math is something that can be fun and that you will use often as you progress as a technologist and more generally as an artist.

In addition to being heavy on math, I am asking you to now shift gears, and make an algorithmic-based artwork from it. Try to have fun, and explore the concepts through art.

## Next Week

Next week will focus almost exclusively on logic, equality, and conditionals. These new tools will give you program control you find yourself wanting this week while trying to create your first algorithmic sketches.
