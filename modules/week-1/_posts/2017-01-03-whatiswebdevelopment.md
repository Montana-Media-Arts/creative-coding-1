# What is Web Development?

*Web Development* is broad term that is intended to cover the technical process of creating, building, and maintaining a web site/s for the Internet. As such, this course will take a technical approach. The goal is to assist you in gaining comfort and skill in the technologies and concepts of modern web development.

## What Web Development is *NOT*
Web development is not necessarily *web design*. Although web design is an aspect of development. Web design is focused on creating the aesthetic feel/look, user experience, and flow of content (although the last of these could be considered content development).

Web design is a critical part of web development and we will spend some time discussing user experience design (UX), layout & flow,  modern design elements, and content creation. These ideas will be discussed within the presentation of techniques and technology. The reason for this is to start creating a gestalt between your creative ideas and technical abilities.
