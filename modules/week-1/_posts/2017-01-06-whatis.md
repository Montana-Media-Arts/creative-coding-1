*Creative Coding* is a broad term that describes the process of using code, low-level technology, and computers as artistic and design tools. This includes the creation of artistic outputs, such as; computer generated images/movies/music/sculptures, interactive installations, games, etc. This term is also used to describe artistic processes that may not result in an output, but instead engage the creator, participant, or normal person to contemplate, re-contextualize, or examine some known truth, experience, or way they previously saw the world.

## What Creative Coding is *NOT*

Creative coding is not standard computer science. The goal of this course is not to teach you how to build a database to manage student accounts at some imaginary school. You may learn the skills necessary for such a task through this course. In fact, you could go on to many more traditional computer science based disciplines after learning how to code. But, this course and the discipline of creative coding is instead intended to marry art, creativity, expression, and code together. The goal is to teach artists (or would-be artists), how to adapt new technologies to their artistic desires. The goal is to teach artists how to think like engineers and approach problem solving through sub-problems and smaller blocks, that can then be built back together. The goal is to explore what expression means when using an abstract tool such as code to engage with artistic processes.
