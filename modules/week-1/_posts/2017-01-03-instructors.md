# Instructor Information

Quick links, including email links, office hours, and lab hours, are all available from the  tab above in the course menubar.

What follows is a more detailed introduction to the people delivering this class to you this semester. We are a team, and will be working together to deliver this experience to you.


## Dr. Michael Musick

I am the professor who built and is now iterating this course. I am also the instructor of record for this course. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, you will need to come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey of beginning to code!

Please feel free to leverage my office hours. I would love it if each and everyone of you who are in Missoula could come by sometime in the first few weeks to introduce yourself. For those of you who are distance learners, please take a moment to look at my website ([michaelmusick.com](http://michaelmusick.com)) and consider sending me an email about yourself, along with something to help me get to know you better, like your own website, or links to your creative work.

With all of that being said, I want to point out that I am incredibly busy here at the University, and am in the process of building another online class this semester (MART441 - Web Technologies). I will work to respond to your questions and problems as quickly as I can. E-mail is most likely the best way to get a hold of me (My email is located above in the instructor tab). I will check my e-mail at least once per day. However, since I am also tasked with building a new online course this semester, I will be getting a lot of help in delivering this course to you from the people listed below. You will actually receive more communication and help from them this semester. This will allow us to make sure you have the resources available to be successful in this course!

His current practice and research is collected under The Sonic Spaces Project which aims to create, explore, and define sonic space ecosystems; a type of eco-art and interactive music system. This project aims to explore principles of complex systems, natural ecosystems, cybernetics, and emergence, through interactive music systems. Michael has additional research interests in installation art, soundscape, and creative improvisation. As a performer, he uses a computer as his instrument to understand, process, amplify, and play with any sounds occurring within the performance space.

> Michael is currently at the University of Montana as an Assistant Professor of Media Arts. In addition to continuing his own research, Michael is teaching courses within Digital Arts and Technology. These courses focus on preparing students to contribute to an evolving world using code and modern technology as creative extensions for their own artistic voices and ideas.

There, he was part of the Computer Music Group within MARL (NYU’s Music and Audio Research Lab) and the Citygram research group.  Prior to NYU, he earned an M.A. in Media Arts from the University of Michigan, where he began his work with performance systems while continuing his studies in creative improvisation and multi-media performance.  Michael also has a background in tuba performance and recording arts; holding performance degrees from The University of Southern California (M.Mus ’09) and The University of Colorado (B.Mus ’07).
