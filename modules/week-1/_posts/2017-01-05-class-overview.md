# What Will This Course Be Like?

Now that you have gone through the syllabus, along with its technical details and policies, lets talk about how this course will actually look like.

## Text & Reading

There will be a lot of reading. Most of the information for this course will be text that I have written write here on this website, text from the required book, or text from linked readings.

## Code Examples

There will obviously also be a lot of code examples. These will show up in your browser and allow you to see exactly what is occurring to create each sketch. In addition, there will always be download buttons for the code, so that you can play with it on your own. Remember, you are learning a new language, this means you will need to take time to explore, play, dissect, rebuild, break, etc.

## Videos

There will also be videos! There will be videos from me, your instructor. This are intended to discuss what is going on, demo how to do something, and talk about concepts.

This course also utilizes a lot of videos from the web on the topic of creative coding. In particular, there will be a lot of videos from Daniel Shiffman's ["Coding Train"](http://thecodingtrain.com). These are excellent resources for learning and exploring code. So, we will use them!

## Pace

As mentioned a few times already, this course will take a lot of your time. We will ramp into the course slowly over the next few weeks.

This week is a chance for you to get the required text book, familiarize yourself with a few new tools on your computer, absorb the syllabus, and schedule out time in your week for class work.

Next week you will learn about the tools you will need to utilize for this course. This will include new programs for your computer, how to utilize github.com, and basic info about how to submit write-ups for the course.

Week three will be when we dive into the meat of coding with p5.js. You should work to make sure your computer is ready and setup between now and then. After we start with p5, we will stick with it for the rest of the semester.

## Dates & Weekly Flow

Currently, I am planning on having weekly "modules" run from Friday to Thursday night.

Homework will be due before the start of the business day on Friday (i.e. 8am Friday morning).



## Homework

You should consider anything within the course lecture content under a *{ TODO: }* section to be part of your "homework".

You will receive additional directives and notes on the homework page for each assignment on the Moodle Shell as well as the ["homework wiki"](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/creative-coding-1/wiki) (Homework assignments will be posted in both locations). Instructions will be provided how to do this over the next two weeks.
