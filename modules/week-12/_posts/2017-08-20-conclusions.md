# Weekly Conclusions

Congratulations! You have finished the final weeks content! You have come so far this semester, it is absolutely amazing!

I will publish a more thorough wrap-up next week. In the mean time, please work on the "Interacting Objects" homework assignment. You will technically have one more assignment after that, but it will not be a code assignment, instead it will be a short reflection on your semester.

As always, if you have problems of questions, please see me during office hours or leverage the Media Arts Lab!
