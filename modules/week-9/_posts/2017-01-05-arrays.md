# Arrays

Thus far, we have used two types of data structures;

- single variables ( `var` )
- and objects ( `{}` )

This week, you are being introduced to _arrays_. 

An  _array_ is a structure for holding a collection of data. Often times, this data is of the same type, although that is not a requirnment in JavaScript. In many ways, _arrays_ are more flexible, powerful, and simpler, than objects. 

Objects are a structure for holding any type of data. Remember, this data is stored in an object using _key:value_ pairs, where a key, much like a vraiable, points to the data. 

An _array_ uses a set of _numbered_ positions to store data. These numbered storage locations within an array are accessed through _index numbers_. 

<br />

#### Creating Arrays

In JavaScript, _arrays_ are specified with square brackets ( `[]` ).

The following would create an _empty array_ and asign it to the variable `myVar`.

```js
var myVar = [];
```

<br />

#### Creating a Prefilled Array

To initialize an array with prefilled _elements_, commas ( `,` ) are used as seperators.

The following would initialize an array with three _elements_.

```js
var myArray = [ “tree”, “hat”, “cat” ];
```

#### Array Elements

We describe the pieces of data in an array as _elements_. In the above example, the has 3 _elements_. 

An element can simply be thought of as a bucket, where we can place data. 

#### Getting Elements with Index Values

In the above example, the array’s three _elements_ are each strings. To get any one of these _elements_, you need to provide the _index_ number of the desired element. So for example, to get and return the string value `”hat”` from the above, we would supply it’s _index_ value to the variable where it is stored. 

The _index_ value is an integer supplied between square brackets, appended to the variable. 

- `variableName[index-integer]`

<!— perhaps the above should be an image and not code? —>

To get the value of `”hat”` from the above example, we would supply the index value of `1`.

```js
var myArray = [ “tree”, “hat”, “cat” ];
myArray[1]; // <- returns “hat”
```

> NOTE: JavaScript is a “0-based” language. That is, numbering always starts at 0.

Since JavaScript is a “0-based” language, the index value of `”hat”` is 1. Likewise;

- The element `”tree”` is at index `0`
- The element `”hat”` is at index `1`
- The element `”cat”` is at index `2`

> This can be confusing to some people, so take a moment for this to sink in. The above array ( `myArray = [ “tree”, “hat”, “cat” ];` ) has a **length** of **3**. However, the **last element** (“cat”) is at **index 2**. 
>
> An array of length **3** has thef following index values.
> 
> [ index 0, index 1, index 2 ];


# Array Length

An array’s _length_ is the number of elements that make up the array. 

To access the number of elements or the rather the _length_ of an array, you can append the _getter method_ `length` to the variable referencing an array.

```js
// initialize an array with some numbers
var myArray = [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ];

// access the length of the array
myArray.length; // <- returns 4
```


# Going Out of Bounds

**You must be careful not to access elements that don't exist!** 

> A common error you will get is “ReferenceError: Can’t find variable: numberList”, which means you tried to reference something that does not exist. 

Be careful to check your code to ensure you pass index values that **exist** to an array.





# What Can Be Stored in Arrays?

As mentioned above, arrays can store any collection of data. The following array contains a number of different data types;

```js
var myArray = [ “umbrella”, 123, -10.3, true ];
```

### Collections of Similar Data

Typically however, you will use an array to store a single data type. The elements in this type of array will typically be used in similar ways throughout your code.
