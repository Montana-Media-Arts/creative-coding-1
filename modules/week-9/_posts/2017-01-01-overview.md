This week, will be a lighter week.

Also, as an opportunity to give you a bit of a break and to allow you time to catch up (if you are behind) there will be NO HOMEWORK this week.

Content wise, you will be learning about arrays this week. These are a new data structure used to hold "iterable collections" of data.
