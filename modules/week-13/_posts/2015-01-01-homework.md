# Homework

Last week was your last regular assignment. As such, you do not have a coding assignment this week. Instead, you should look at the next page where you will be given information about the final. Additionally, you are expected to submit final proposals next week, when homework would regularly be due.

# Lingering and Late Homework Cutoff

- _Late homework cutoff: **{{site.data.dates.hwCutoff}}**_

If you still have lingering homework assignments that you would like to submit for partial credit, these need to get submitted ASAP. These need to be in, so that we have time to grade them before final grades will be due to the registrar. As such, late homework will no longer be accepted after **{{site.data.dates.hwCutoff}}**.
