# Final Project

As mentioned in the syllabus, you are responsible for a final project in this class. This final project is an artistic piece of your devising, developed with p5.js.

The final project should be something beyond what you have attempted previously in this course. This is a challenge for you to create a work of art, using p5.js, that relates to or builds from your other artistic interests and focuses. Perhaps this is a music visualizer, a simple game, a narrative scene, a complex generative artwork, or something else. It is up to you!

## Specifications

- **Deadlines:**
    - _Proposal: Due {{site.data.dates.finalProposal}}_
    - _Final Project Submission: Due {{site.data.dates.finalSubmission}}_

<br />

- Size:
    - The final project should be equivalent to approximately 3 weeks worth of work on regular assignments.
- Scope:
    - The final project can topically be about whatever you are passionate about.
    - The major requirement is that it is a creative artwork that utilizes p5.js as the primary tool.
- Tools and Content:
    - You are encouraged, and welcome, to utilize content that you create in other environments.
        - As an example, you may want to create backgrounds or other images in Illustrator of Photoshop that you then pull into your final project sketch.
        - You are also free to use audio content or video content.
        - I want you to utilize skills developed in all of your classes up till this point towards your final project for this class.
    - If you need to bring in content that types that we have not demo'd yet in this course, then you will need to Google and research how to do so. You are also welcome to ask the Lab Assistants and Teaching Assistant for help.
    - You are welcome to utilize techniques not discussed in this class if they are necessary for your project. However, you are expected to research how to incorporate them with p5.js.
    - However, you should be able to use vanilla p5 to do almost anything you could think of for this final project.

## Final Project Proposal

This week, you should develop plans and initial sketches for your final project. You are to submit a link to a markdown file, located in your git repo, that describes the following.

- A proposal for what you want to create for your final project.
- Related and similar work that is serving as an inspiration.
    - Briefly discuss other artists or projects that are similar or influential to your proposed final project.
- A brief discussion of any problems you know you will have to solve or new technologies/techniques you will need to learn.
- A work plan, with internal deadlines for yourself and a description about how you intent to complete the final project on time. (Note: there will be no extensions offered for the final project).
- A discussion of any work you have completed this week towards your final project.

> Note: You should start working on your final project immediately. You should start working on your final project before the proposal is due. You should also not wait on a reply to your proposal to keep working in your final project. We will not respond to Final Project Proposals unless there are major issues with your proposal or we deem you final project to not be appropriate (either impossible or too easy).

#### Final Project Proposal Worth

**The final project proposal is worth 20% of your final project grade.** (Note: that equates to 3% of your total course grade.)

> Required: Please note, the final project is **required**. Failure to complete a final project will result in a letter grade of F for the course. This is regardless of the students current grade standing in the course. There are no exceptions to this policy.
