This week is all about functions, what they are, how to use them, and how to write your own.

By now, you likely see how important functions are to everything you are doing, so it is therefore critical that you understand them at a little deeper level. This weeks content allows this to occur, while showing you how they can be used to optimize code you have previously written!

#### Functions are awesome!

You are going to write so many functions during the rest of this semester, and in every coding class going forward. They can be tricky to understand at first, but is another one of these _critical_ concepts, that you must understand.
