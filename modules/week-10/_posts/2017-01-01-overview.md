This week, will be a short week, both with respect to content and the length of the week. Please note, in order to adjust for Thanksgiving, I will be doing a short week this week, ending next Tuesday. We will then have full length weeks until Thanksgiving break.

Also, as a result, there will be no homework this week.

Content wise, you will be learning about arrays this week. These are a new data structure used to hold "iterable collections" of data.
