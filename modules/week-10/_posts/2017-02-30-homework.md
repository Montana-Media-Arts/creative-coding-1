# Homework

For your homework this week you can either;

1. Refactor an existing homework project; adapting it to use functions and an array.
2. Create a new creative sketch, that utilizes functions and arrays.

My example below demonstrates the work we did this week in class, by creating a complex, generative smiley face example.

## Specification

1. You must create and use at least one array.
2. You must write and use at least two functions, (not counting `setup()` or `draw()`).
3. This should be "interesting" to look at.

As always, you should comment your code, write a readme, and provide links on the HW forum to both your git repo, and live sketch.



# Instructor Example

For this week's example, I do a number of things. However, the main goal was to create a sketch with smiley faces that rotate on the `x` and `y` axis according to a sinusoidal function. This sine function determines not only relative position, but also the scale factor of the smiley face.

As you can see from the code;

- I created an array (`smileys`), to store objects holding data about each smiley.
- I also created a variable `t` to track the progression of time.
- In the setup function, I push 20 objects, representing various aspects of data necessary to draw each smiley.
- Below the draw loop, I write 3 functions.
- The first of these, `drawSmiley()` accepts a smiley object as its input. It then calls the sine function to determine position on both the `x` and `y` axis, and also calls the function to actually draw each smiley (`smileyFace()`).
- The `smileyFace()` function is the same one you saw earlier this week.
- The `sinePos()` function determines a position value based on the movement of time (`time`) and the `timeScale` of each individual smiley object.
- Finally, in the `draw()` function, the array of smileys is worked through and used to draw smiley faces in orbit.
- However, I also included a map function that maps the `mouseX` position between `0` and the `length` of the smiley array. Thereby, allowing the user to determine how many orbiting smileys that see.
