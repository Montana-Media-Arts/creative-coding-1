# Weekly Conclusions

**Functions!!!**

Wasn't this week fun? There is so much you can do, especially now that you can write functions. Take the time to learn this weeks material. It is critical.

If you are having problems, please go to lab hours, email your classmates/colleagues, or come see me during my office hours.

## Next Week

Next week we will learn how to make _classes_, which is one of the most important concepts in computer science. Please give yourself plenty of time for next week's content.
