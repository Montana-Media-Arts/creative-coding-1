# while Loops

Another type of loop, very similar to _for loops_ are _while loops_.

_while loops_;

- _do something_
- as long as, a conditional check function returns `true`.

As just mentioned _while loops_ are very similar to _for loops_. _for loops tend to be used when there is some value, that will be incremented/decremented in some way, with a specific measurable end in relation to the updating value.

_while loops_ tend to be used when there is some condition that will change in the course of the loop, but is not necessarily incremental based.

## In Practice

_while loops_ will be setup as follows;

1. The keyword `while`
2. Followed by a set of parentheses where a conditional statement will be evaluated.
3. If the statement returns `true` then the _function block_ of the loop is executed.
4. At the end of the _function blocks_ execution, the conditional statement is executed again. If it returns `true` again, then the _function block_ is executed again.
5. If instead the conditional statement returns `false`, then the loop is exited.

```js
// while loop syntax example
while( conditionStatement ) {
	// function block to do something
}
```

One of the things to be careful with _while loops_ is compose them, so that eventually, they will exit.


## An Example

In the following example, the while loop is used to create a random number of dots, placed on a grid, with 50px spacing.  The while loops checks the variable `x` each iteration to see if it equals 0. If it does, then the while loops exits, and the `draw()` starts all over again.

```js
let rows, x_space;
let cols, y_space;

function setup() {
	createCanvas( windowWidth, 400 );
	frameRate( 5 );

	x_space = 50;
	rows = floor( width / x_space );
	y_space = 50;
	cols = floor( height / y_space );
}



function draw() {
	background( 'pink' );

	noStroke();

	// Initialize ‘x’ to a dummy value.
	let x = 1;
	let y = 1;
	while ( x != 0 ){
		x = floor(random() * rows);
		y = floor(random() * cols);

		fill( random(175,255), random(175,255), random(175,255) );
		ellipse( x*x_space, y*y_space, random(10, 50) );
	}
}
```
