# Homework

For your homework this week, you are to create a sketch that utilizes loops (_for loops_, or _while loops_), to some creative ends.

I am leaving it **really wide open** for you to explore in ways that you find interesting. It could be generative abstract drawings, a small animation of characters, or something else...

As always, please;

- comment thourghouly,
- write a detailed readme.md,
- and upload links to your live sketch and repo directory at the HW Wiki.
