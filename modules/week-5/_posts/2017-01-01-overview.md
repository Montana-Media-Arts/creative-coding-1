This week builds on last weeks exploration of drawing in p5, by moving into the realm of animation. In order to start animating your own p5 sketches, you will learn about;

- loops
- frame rate
- p5 variables
- making/using your own variables
- and simple math

Additionally, some additional information on how to make "readable" code will be presented.
