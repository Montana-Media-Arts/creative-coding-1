# HW 5 | Animation, Variables, & Simple Math

Using the `draw()` function, create a sketch that changes over time! This sketch can take one of two directions;

1. You can create a character of some sort (similar to last week) that moves
2. You can create an abstract image that changes over time.

Remember, the key to creating a dynamic sketch is to have function arguments that change overtime, between subsequent iterations of the `draw()` loop.

## Specs:

This sketch should include (all of these):

- Obvious change over time (animation).
    - This means that the "meat" of your work will be in the `draw()` function.
    - You will need to use the `setup()` function to "setup" your sketch. This includes;
        - `createCanvas()`
- Your sketch should leverage variables to store data, alter data, and pass data around.
    - Remember, you use the `var` keyword to define a variable _symbolic name_.
    - Remember, variable naming conventions and style guides.
        - [w3schools variable tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
        - [multi-word conventions](http://javascript.info/draft/variable-naming)
    - Pay attention to "scope".
        - i.e. where you define a variable and how it is used.
        - Remember, variables defined outside of `setup()` and `draw()` are available _globally_.
        - Variables defined in scope and draw are only available to the function they are in.
        - Variables defined inside `draw()` will be reset every loop.
            - i.e. The following will result in the value `2` every time;

```javascript
draw(){
    let incrementingNumber = 1;
    incrementingNumber = incrementingNumber + 1;
}
```

<br />

- Your sketch should include, 1 element that changes over time, independently of the mouse (i.e. use variable math).
- Your sketch should include, 1 element controlled by the mouse.
    - `mouseX`
    - `mouseY`
- Your sketch should include, 1 element that is in relation to the canvas size.
    - You will need to use the `width` and/or `height` environment variables to do this.
- Your sketch should also follow the style, naming, and readability guidelines presented this week.

You should also continue to use the skills, functions, and techniques presented in the previous week. This will be necessary to complete the assignment (but you will not be graded for the inclusion).

As always, include lots of comments about what each section, _does_, or is _trying to do_.

# Submission

As always, you should create a new `hw-5/` directory, in the top level of your git repo. You will provide links to both the;

- [live sketch](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/120_CreativeCoding/hwExamples/HW-5/)
- [homework repo directory](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/tree/master/hwExamples/HW-5)


# Example

As an example, look at the "Creepy Spinning Variable Person" from the [simple math]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-5/simple-math/).

<div id="jotted-demo-3" class="jotted-theme-stacked" style="800px;"></div>

<script>
    new Jotted(document.querySelector("#jotted-demo-3"), {
    files: [
        {
            type: "js",
            hide: false,
            url:"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/master/hwExamples/HW-5/sketch.js"
        },
        {
            type: "html",
            hide: true,
            url:"../../../p5_resources/index.html"
        }
    ],
    showBlank: false,
    showResult: true,
    plugins: [
        { name: 'ace', options: { "maxLines": 150 } },
        // { name: 'console', options: { autoClear: true } },
    ]
});
</script>
