# Final Project Overview <br />

As mentioned in the syllabus, you are responsible for a final project in this class. This final project is an artistic piece of your devising developed with p5.js.

The final project should be something beyond what you have attempted previously in this course. This is a challenge for you to create a work of art, using p5.js, that relates to or builds from your other artistic interests and focuses. Perhaps this is a music visualizer, a simple game, a narrative scene, a complex generative artwork, or something else. It is up to you!
