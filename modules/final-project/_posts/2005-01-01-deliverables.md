# Final Project Deliverables

When submitting the final project, you should submit links to your live site and readme file as you typically do for normal homework assignments. These will be submitted to a special Final Project tab and forum in Moodle.

## Live Site

There are no specified distinctions that your live site for your final project should have apart from those of normal homework assignments.

## README.md

Your readme.md should be far more significant that typical homework readme's have been. This readme should describe and document your process over the entire life cycle of your final project. It should also spend a significant amount of time discussing the final product, and your successes or failures.
