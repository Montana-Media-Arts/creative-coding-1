# Final Project Deliverables

When submitting the final project, you should submit links to your live site and readme file as you typically do for normal homework assignments. These will be submitted to a special Final Project tab and forum in Moodle.

## Live Site

There are no specified distinctions that your live site for your final project should have apart from those of normal homework assignments.

## README.md

Your readme.md should be far more significant that typical homework readme's have been. This readme should describe and document your process over the entire life cycle of your final project. It should also spend a significant amount of time discussing the final product, and your successes or failures.

## Worth

The final project site and extended readme.md document will constitute 80% of your "Final Project" grade. (The other 20% is associated with the proposal).

> As a reminder, your final project makes up 15% of your total grade for the class. Therefore, the final project proposal is equivalent to 3% of your final grade, and the final project proper is equivalent to 12% of your final grade.

# Final Project is Mandatory

As a reminder: The final project is **required**. Failure to complete a final project will result in a letter grade of F for the course. This is regardless of the students current grade standing in the course. There are no exceptions to this policy.
