    - The final project can topically be about whatever you are passionate about.
    - The major requirement is that it is a creative artwork that utilizes p5.js as the primary tool.
- Tools and Content:
    - You are encouraged, and welcome, to utilize content that you create in other environments.
        - As an example, you may want to create backgrounds or other images in Illustrator of Photoshop that you then pull into your final project sketch.
        - You are also free to use audio content or video content.
        - I want you to utilize skills developed in all of your classes up till this point towards your final project for this class.
    - If you need to bring in content that types that we have not demo'd yet in this course, then you will need to Google and research how to do so. You are also welcome to ask the Lab Assistants and Teaching Assistant for help.
    - You are welcome to utilize techniques not discussed in this class if they are necessary for your project. However, you are expected to research how to incorporate them with p5.js.
    - However, you should be able to use vanilla p5 to do almost anything you could think of for this final project.
