# Getting Help

Remember, you have lots of options for places to get help from. You might find yourself needing help;

- Coming up with final project ideas.
- Checking whether a final project idea is too hard.
- Checking whether a final project idea is rigorous enough.
- Working with media, such as images, videos, or sound.
- Implementing, _X_, _Y_, or _Z_ feature.
- etc.

This is our favorite time of year! You are starting some of your most interesting work yet! So please, feel free to ask for help! It is welcomes and encouraged. You can utilize any of the options discussed in the **[Help]({{site.baseurl}}/help/)** tab of this site.
