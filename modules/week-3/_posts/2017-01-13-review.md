# p5, From a Different Angle

The following video was created by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/about/), and instructor at [NYU's ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program)](http://itp.nyu.edu/) who is also focused in creative coding. I will include a number of his videos throughout this semester, as he does a nice job explaining these topics as well. The video from Daniel that I am asking you to watch this week, provides you with an alternate angle to the same topics I have been discussing.

> NOTE: This video is from 2015, and portions of the p5 mission have changed. Chief among these is that they no longer are pursuing the creation of their own standalone editor. As such, please ignore the bits about downloading the editor, you will need to continue using Atom or the text editor of your choice, and a web browser.
