# HTML
This week we are going to start using HTML or the HyperText Markup Language.

HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. HTML was first proposed in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, then a contract physicist at CERN.

To learn a little more about the history of HTML, you should read the [“History” section from the associated Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History) & [Amy Hisson’s “History of HTML and CSS”](http://amyhissom.com/HTML5-CSS3/history.html).
