# Wrap Up & Conclusions

You have gone over a lot of material this week. We;

- Introduced p5.js and what it is.
- Talked about how to setup a basic "empty" p5 code sketch.
- Discussed and created two "Hello World!" sketches.
- Look at how they work
- Introduced "Comments"
- Presented how to search and read the p5 reference documentation
- Presented what `setup()` and `draw()` do and how to declare these function.
- Discussed what a function is.
- Talked about function input parameters.
- Setup a live webpage with your "Hello World!" p5 sketch.

This is a lot, congratulations for getting everything done this week! If some elements were confusing, please ask for help on the Issues board, email me, or come by my office hours.

If you haven't yet done so, and you are in Missoula, I would also highly encourage you try and find a "study group". This is something you could also use the Issue's board to setup. Working together is always helpful (Just make sure you do you own work!). If you are a distance student, I would suggest you try and setup a virtual study group that meets over Google Hangout or something.

## Next Week

Next week we will dive more deeply in to p5, and look at how we can use Primitive Shapes to create either a self-portrait or monster drawing!
