# Week 3 Overview <br />

Active: {{ site.data.dates[page.module][0] }}

Homework Due: {{ site.data.dates[page.module][1] }}


This week you will start to learn about programming basics, along with the specifics of p5. There are a lot of details to become comfortable with. Because of this your homework will be very basic. Instead of worrying about homework for the week, you should work to become comfortable with the the basics of p5, including;

- How to setup an empty p5 sketch.
- How to open and view a p5 sketch in the browser.
- How to read and search through p5 reference documentation.
- How to create a canvas.
- How to color the background of a canvas.
- How to create a live p5 webpage with GitHub pages.


Of course, before we start with any of that, we should find out what p5 is first, and that is what you will start this week with, a conversation about p5.js.
