# The Body Element

The _body element_ is where all of the “meat & potatoes”, if you will, of the site gets placed. This is the data that I rendered by the browser and displayed on the clients local computer.

Within the body there will generally be 2 types of markup used;

1. Structural markup
2. Semantic markup

## Structural Markup
Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document. Structure includes elements such as;

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Breaks
- Lists

These elements will help guide a user visually and provide information about the type of content through a document. These elements are also used by the browser and DOM to understand the content of a document. A browser will use this structural markup to assist [screen readers](http://www.afb.org/prodBrowseCatResults.aspx?CatID=49) and other accessibility-based software.

## Semantic Markup
Semantic markup us used to reinforce the [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics), or meaning, of the information in a document. Semantic markup might be used to place _emphasis_ on a word or phrase, identify a word as being **strong**, provide <cite>citations</cite> or <q>quotations</q>, link to <dfn>definitions</dfn>, or distinguish <del>editorial changes</del>.
