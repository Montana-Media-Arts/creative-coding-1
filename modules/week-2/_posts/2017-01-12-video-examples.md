# Video Setup Examples for YOUR Environment

To help you see the process of setting up your development environment, I have created demo videos for both Mac and Windows. These walk through the entire setup of your machine from having nothing installed, to being able to create Markdown documents and get them hosted on GitHub.com.

**{ Note: }** The suggested workflow has changed slightly since these videos were made. Although I am set to remake them, I may not have by the time you get to this page. The workflow described on the previous pages should be used _INSTEAD OF_ the video information. Please still watch the videos though for information on the entire process and related information.
