# GIT Version Control System

One great thing about working with text files is that their simplicity makes it easy to track changes between various versions of a file. Since the files contain only [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com) characters, it is easy to create programs that can look for character or word level changes to a document.

## Why use Version Control?

- Version control allows a developer/writer to make changes to a file and track their changes over time. By 'committing' changes to a file with a simple, associated message, the developer can create a list of how they have changed the file over time.
- Version control also allows for a developer/writer to make changes that may or may not work; to essentially try something without being fully committed. If they find that the change they made was inappropriate, or did not work, they can simply go back to a previous version. There is no need for directories full of "save as" files.
- Version control makes collaboration and sharing easier. Then all associated parties can see all changes made by each other, and manage any conflicts that may occur within a file from changing it at the same time.

## Why are we using GIT

- I want you to use GIT so that you can track incremental changes to your work throughout your weekly assignments.

  - This will allow you to see your own change history.
  - This will allow you to try things, and know that if they do not work well, you can easily go back to what you had working before.

- Your git repositories (or repo's) can easily be integrated with GitHub.com (discussed in the next section). This gives;

  - Built in distributed cloud backup for free.
  - A free hosted webspace. (This is how you will submit assignments during most of the course).
  - This allows me and the graduate instructors to easily see your work/code and track the changes you made during the weekly development cycle.

- The last reason you will be using GIT is because it is a standard industry tool in both commercial and research facilities. Your familiarity and comfort with it will make you a better future collaborator.

## Typical Git Workflow

If you read further in the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book, you will see that the typical workflow for git is via the command line or terminal. Rather than introduce you to the command line, we are instead going to use a _GUI-based_ (Graphical User Interface. Pronounced _gooey_) git client app. This will be introduced on the next page.
