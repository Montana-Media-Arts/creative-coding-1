4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

# Step by Step Instructions

## 1: Write your `readme.md`

- On your development machine.
- Create a new document labeled `readme.md` inside of the `hw-2` directory, inside your git repo. (This can be done in finder, explorer, command line, or your text editor).
- Open this file in your text editor application (i.e., Atom or Visual Studio Code).
- The first line of text should be your name. ie `Michael Musick`
- Using appropriate markup-syntax, discuss your work for the week according to the 5 prompts from the above section.
- You should have at least one of each of the following elements in this document (NOTE: One instance of some of these elements will be insufficient. Such as headings, which you will likely need multiple of...)
    1. Header Level 1
    2. Header Level 2
    3. An un-ordered list
    4. An ordered list
    5. A link to another site
    6. Inline code (i.e. using single backticks [code quote example](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code)) or a multi-line code block (i.e. using three backticks at the top and bottom. [Code block example](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)). ALSO, PLEASE NOTE: the backtick (on most keyboards) is the key located left of the "1" key and above "tab" key. It is different from the single apostrophe.
- Finally, you should include a picture of your markdown file within your text editor. To do this;
	- Take a screen shot of your editor from your computer. ([How to take a screen shot on macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) --- [How to take a screen shot on Windows](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-any-version-of-windows/))
	- Move the image to the `hw-2` directory.
	- Embed the image in your document using the following code; `![Image of my editor](name-of-the-image-file.jpg)`. (NOTE: Spelling, including capitalization are critical. Please also remember to _NOT USE_ spaces. Use dashes or underscores instead.)

NOTE: Please edit, spell-check, and re-read your writing. Unfortunately, you will be marked down for poor writing.

## 2: Commit you changes and push them to the GitHub repo

When you are finished with your write up, you should ‘stage’ this new `readme.md` file, along with the image file, and changed `test1.txt` in your Git repo via GitHub Desktop. Commit these files to the repo, then push your changes to the GitHub server.

(NOTE: If you are uncomfortable with this, review the steps from the previous page)

## 3: Copy the Link

After pushing the commits, navigate to your repo on GitHub.com in your browser. You should see the new directory in the file list.

Click on the new directory (`/hw-2`) to see its contents. You should see the readme file and the image file. Additionally, below the file list, you should see the contents of the `readme.md` file rendered and presented.
